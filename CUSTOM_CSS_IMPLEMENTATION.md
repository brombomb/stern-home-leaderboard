# Custom CSS Override Feature Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a custom CSS override feature for the Stern Home Leaderboard that allows users to provide their own CSS files via environment variables and Docker volume mounts. The custom CSS is loaded last to ensure it can override any existing styles.

## Components Added

### 1. CSS Injection Script
**File**: `frontend/scripts/inject-custom-css.js`

- Node.js script that runs before the React application starts
- Checks for custom CSS file specified in `CUSTOM_CSS_PATH` environment variable
- Injects CSS content into HTML `<head>` section as inline styles
- Automatically removes previously injected CSS if file is no longer available
- Includes error handling and logging

### 2. Package.json Updates
**File**: `frontend/package.json`

- Added `prestart` and `prebuild` scripts to run CSS injection automatically
- Scripts execute before React starts or builds, ensuring CSS is always current

### 3. Dockerfile Enhancement
**File**: `frontend/Dockerfile`

- Added creation of `/app/custom-css` directory for volume mounting
- Prepared container filesystem for external CSS file mounting

### 4. Docker Compose Configuration
**File**: `docker-compose.yml`

- Added `CUSTOM_CSS_PATH` environment variable support
- Included commented volume mount example for easy user configuration

### 5. Example Files
**Directory**: `examples/`

- `custom-styles.css`: Comprehensive example CSS with theme customizations
- `docker-compose-with-custom-css.yml`: Complete Docker Compose example
- `README.md`: Detailed usage instructions and troubleshooting

### 6. Documentation Updates
**File**: `README.md`

- Added complete "Custom CSS Overrides" section
- Included setup instructions and examples
- Added troubleshooting guide
- Updated environment variables documentation

### 7. ESLint Configuration
**File**: `frontend/scripts/.eslintrc.json`

- Created script-specific ESLint config allowing console statements
- Maintains code quality while enabling necessary logging

## How It Works

1. **Environment Setup**: User sets `CUSTOM_CSS_PATH` environment variable
2. **Volume Mount**: User mounts their CSS file to the specified container path
3. **Pre-execution**: CSS injection script runs before React starts/builds
4. **File Detection**: Script checks if custom CSS file exists at specified path
5. **Content Injection**: CSS content is injected into HTML as inline styles
6. **Override Priority**: Custom CSS loads last, ensuring it can override existing styles
7. **Cleanup**: Script removes old CSS if file is no longer available

## Usage Examples

### Basic Setup
```bash
# Set environment variable
export CUSTOM_CSS_PATH=/app/custom-css/overrides.css

# Mount CSS file in docker-compose.yml
volumes:
  - ./my-styles.css:/app/custom-css/overrides.css:ro
```

### Example CSS Override
```css
/* Change primary color */
body {
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, #1a1a2e, #16213e) !important;
}

/* Customize machine cards */
.machine-card {
  border: 2px solid #ffd700 !important;
  border-radius: 15px !important;
}
```

## Features

- ✅ Environment variable configuration (`CUSTOM_CSS_PATH`)
- ✅ Docker volume mount support
- ✅ Automatic CSS injection into HTML head
- ✅ Override priority (loaded after all other styles)
- ✅ Automatic cleanup when CSS file is removed
- ✅ Comprehensive example CSS file
- ✅ Complete documentation and examples
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ ESLint compliance for scripts

## Testing Completed

1. **Script Functionality**: Verified CSS injection and removal works correctly
2. **Environment Variables**: Tested with and without `CUSTOM_CSS_PATH` set
3. **Docker Build**: Confirmed Docker build succeeds with new configuration
4. **File Detection**: Verified script properly detects file existence/absence
5. **HTML Injection**: Confirmed CSS is properly injected into HTML head
6. **Cleanup**: Verified old CSS is removed when file is unavailable

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Hot reloading of CSS changes during development
- Multiple CSS file support
- CSS validation and syntax checking
- Theme presets and CSS variable support
- Web interface for CSS editing

## Maintenance

- CSS injection script is self-contained and requires minimal maintenance
- ESLint configuration ensures code quality
- Comprehensive error handling prevents application failures
- Clear logging helps with troubleshooting
